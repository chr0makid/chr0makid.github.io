Hi there! I'm Fedor, 17 years old Junior Game Developer & Logo designer also recently known as chromakid. I'm interersted in making unusual, interesting and atmospheric games. Currently continue to work as a solo developer, but I really want to find a team of devs and artists like me, so we would work on our projects together in future. If you are a developer, artis, or just a trainee who wants to create exciting games - just let me know, and in one day it will be known as a start of our team!
